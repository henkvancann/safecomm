### A DIGITAL ARCHITECTURE FOR PEACE

Business Plan for Peace and the Dutch Ministry of Defence invite you to help in the challenge of preventing human suffering and shifting humanity’s habit away from violent conflict towards the prevention of conflict.

**Invitation**<br/>
Business Plan for Peace and the Dutch Ministry of Defence are inviting policy makers, NGOs working on peace, army personnel, people living in ‘conflict areas’, and many other stakeholders to work with the teams, be the first to test and give feedback to the solutions, and then help launch the best solutions after the event.
